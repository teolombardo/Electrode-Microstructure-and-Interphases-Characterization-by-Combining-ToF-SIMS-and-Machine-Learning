# Electrode-Microstructure-and-Interphases-Characterization-by-Combining-ToF-SIMS-and-Machine-Learning

This code allows combining the spatial distribution coming from multiple secondary ions maps obtained through time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) into a single image and segmenting it (i.e., every pixel is assigned to one SI only). The SI should be selected as a fingerprint of a given (inter)phase of the battery electrode microstructure being analyzed. If this is the case, every pixel assigned to a given SI is also assigned to the (inter)phase of interest. In addition, the segmented image is analyzed to determine the overall volume fractions and interfaces, as well as the single particle/agglomerate size distribution, aspect ratio, and interfaces.

A complete description of how using this code can be found in the "Documentation" pdf file.
